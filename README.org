#+title: CarsonHenrich/Wallpapers
Heyo! Welcome to my repository of wallpapers which I have gathered from others
(primarily [[https://github.com/orangci/walls][organci]]). My typical use of this
repository is in conjunction with [[https://github.com/carsonhenrich/wallpapers-themed][carsonhenrich/wallpapers-themed]] 
which uses a base16 theme to alter the color palette of an image.
